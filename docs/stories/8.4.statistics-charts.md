**I want** 검증 통계와 차트를 확인하기를 원합니다,
**so that** 전체적인 품질 추세를 파악할 수 있습니다.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. 날짜별 성공률 추이 차트가 표시된다
2. 이슈 유형별 분포 차트가 표시된다
3. 계정별 검증 상태 차트가 표시된다
4. 통계 요약 (평균 실행 시간, False Positive rate)이 표시된다

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Integrate Chart.js library (AC: 1, 2, 3)

## Dev Notes

**Frontend Stack**:
- Chart.js ^4.4.0
- Canvas elements for charts
- Responsive chart sizing

**Status**: ⏳ DEFERRED TO PHASE 2
This story is not included in MVP/Phase 1. Will be implemented as enhancement in Phase 2.

**Chart Types**:
- Line Chart: Date vs Success Rate (%)
- Pie Chart: Issue Type Distribution
- Bar Chart: Account vs Property Count/Issues

**Data Sources**:
- Historical results from `results/` folder
- Aggregated summaries from API
- Calculated statistics

**Integration Points**:
- Fetches from: REST API endpoints
- Updates: On date filter change
- Renders: In dedicated chart section

### Testing

**Test Location**: Manual testing in browser

**Testing Standards** (Future):
- Chart rendering with sample data
- Responsive chart sizing
- Tooltip accuracy
- Data aggregation correctness
- Performance with large datasets
