top_issues:
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Test suite not executed - developer unable to verify tests pass due to environment limitations"
    suggested_action: "Execute `npm test` to verify all 34 tests pass (14 Story 1.1 + 10 Story 1.2 + 10 Story 1.3). This is verification step, not a blocker."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Input validation via JSON.parse with error handling. No hardcoded secrets. Safe cache directory creation. No path traversal vulnerabilities."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "O(n) Set-based comparison provides optimal performance. JSON I/O overhead is negligible. No blocking operations. Expected overhead <1ms per comparison."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful degradation on cache failures. First-run scenario handled without errors. Corrupt cache doesn't crash application. Save failures are logged but non-blocking."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear function names and purpose. Consistent error handling pattern. Well-documented with JSDoc PropertyChanges typedef. Easy to test and debug."
