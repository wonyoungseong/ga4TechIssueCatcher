  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No sensitive data handled. Safe error handling with no data leakage.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Minimal performance impact. Single page.evaluate() calls are efficient.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful error handling ensures validation continues even on AP_DATA extraction failures. Non-blocking design prevents cascading failures.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation of concerns. Well-documented code with clear comments mapping to ACs. Consistent error handling patterns.'
