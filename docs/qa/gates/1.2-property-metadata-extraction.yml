nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All inputs validated with regex patterns. Format validation prevents injection attacks. Invalid data is logged and skipped."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Validation overhead is negligible (~0.1ms per row). Expected file size ~100 properties = ~10ms total overhead."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive validation prevents malformed data. Warning logs provide traceability. Graceful degradation for optional fields."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Centralized VALIDATION_PATTERNS constant. Excellent JSDoc @typedef Property documentation. Clear separation of validation logic."
