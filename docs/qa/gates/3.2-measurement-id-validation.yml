# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Function validates measurement IDs from events without exposing sensitive data. Uses safe comparison operators."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance with O(n) complexity where n=number of events. Test execution time ~2ms. Early returns optimize for common cases."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "100% test pass rate (12/12). Comprehensive error handling for null/missing data. Deterministic results with proper validation."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear function signature with JSDoc. Low cognitive complexity (cyclomatic: 3). Well-organized test structure with AC mapping. Reuses extractMeasurementId() helper for DRY principle."

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding validation for measurement ID format (G-[A-Z0-9]{10}) at validation layer for defense-in-depth"
      refs: ["src/modules/configValidator.js:212-252"]
      priority: "low"
      rationale: "Currently relies on networkEventCapturer for format validation. Adding explicit format validation would provide additional safety layer."
