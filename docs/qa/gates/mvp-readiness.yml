# Risk Assessment
risk_summary:
  totals:
    critical: 0
    high: 0
    medium: 0
    low: 1
  identified_risks:
    - risk: "6 stories in 'Ready for Done' or 'Ready for Review' status"
      severity: "LOW"
      impact: "Administrative only - functionality complete"
      mitigation: "Status updates recommended before production deployment"
      residual_risk: "NONE"

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Update story statuses: 5 stories from 'Ready for Done' to 'Done', 1 story from 'Ready for Review' to 'Done'"
      refs: ["stories/1.2", "stories/1.3", "stories/3.2", "stories/3.3", "stories/3.5", "stories/7.1"]
      priority: "LOW"
      rationale: "Administrative cleanup - does not block MVP deployment"
  before_production:
    - action: "Run end-to-end MVP test with real CSV data"
      refs: ["Full system integration test"]
      priority: "MEDIUM"
      rationale: "Validate complete workflow with production-like data"
    - action: "Create MVP release notes documenting features and known limitations"
      refs: ["Release documentation"]
      priority: "MEDIUM"
      rationale: "Clear communication of MVP scope and excluded features"
  future_enhancements:
    - action: "Implement Story 8.4 (Statistics and Charts) in Phase 2"
      refs: ["stories/8.4"]
      priority: "LOW"
      rationale: "Deferred feature for future release"
    - action: "Implement Epic 5 (Slack Integration) if business need arises"
      refs: ["stories/5.1", "stories/5.2"]
      priority: "LOW"
      rationale: "Intentionally excluded - can be added if requirements change"
